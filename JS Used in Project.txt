Javascript Added:

Ad banner in the Home folder, index.cshtml page that allows users to click on the "x" in the top right corner to remove the banner.
This is the "window.onload = function method".

Also, I added a onclick method called "Redirect(this)" that will confirm the user's choice to redirect or stay on the page.
This is also in the Home folder, index.cshtml page.


On both men's and women's outfits buttons in the Home folder, index.cshtml page,two functionm (bigText(x) and normalText(x)) 
works when a user mouseover or mouseout the buttons. The function changes the color and size of text.


In the Shared folder, _Layout.cshtml page, my p tag in the footer section has an id of "footerChange" and two functions (changeCopy(this) and defaultCopy(this))\
which changes the text of the paragraph when a user hovers over it.

Using the drag event in MensOutfit index. Users should be able to mix and matct items on the page. (Does not fully work.)
